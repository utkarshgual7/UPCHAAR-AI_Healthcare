Developed an innovative virtual healthcare platform aimed at making healthcare more affordable and accessible. The platform includes:

AI Chatbot and Scanner: Created using Flask and Langchain, this feature provides preliminary diagnoses based on user symptoms and allows patients to upload medical scans for virtual, doctor-like analysisâ€”all at no cost.

Web Application: Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

This initiative enhances patient care by offering convenient and reliable initial assessments before scheduling appointments with healthcare professionals.
